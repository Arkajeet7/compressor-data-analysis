# 🚀 Compressor Performance Analysis & Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was completed as part of my **summer internship at Tata Motors, Jamshedpur**, where I applied machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze energy efficiency and predict failures in industrial compressors. The project involved working with both **real-time sensor data** and a **benchmark dataset** to overcome data quality limitations and improve model validation.
