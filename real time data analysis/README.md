# 📘 Compressor Analysis Using Real-Time Data

This folder contains the primary code and dataset used during my summer internship at Tata Motors, Jamshedpur. The objective was to analyze compressor energy efficiency and predict potential failures using real-time sensor data and machine learning techniques.

## 📄 Contents
- `compressor_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook implementing the end-to-end ML pipeline
- `real_time_dataset.csv` — Raw data collected from compressor units (anonymized)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Neural networks using Keras (optional if used)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering

## 🧠 Key Tasks
- Analyzed compressor output patterns using statistical and ML models
- Trained a neural network for failure classification and energy prediction
- Identified limitations in real-time data for production-grade deployment

## 📌 Notes
Due to inconsistencies in real-time data (incomplete logs and noise), a benchmarking dataset was also used (see `../benchmarking-data/`).
