# 🗂️ Benchmarking Dataset for Compressor Analysis

This folder contains a curated sample dataset sourced from publicly available industrial data repositories. It was used to benchmark and validate ML model performance during the Tata Motors internship project, due to inconsistencies in the real-time data.

## 📄 Contents
- `aircompressor.csv` — Benchmark dataset used for model training and evaluation
- `compressor_prediction_.ipynb` — Code for training and validating models using clean data

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Model trained using Artificial Neural Network

## ✅ Purpose
- Provide a clean and reliable data reference to compare model performance
- Evaluate real-time model accuracy against benchmarked outputs

## 📌 Notes
This dataset helped simulate real-world compressor behavior and served as a fallback to test the generalizability of trained models.
